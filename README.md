Abstract:
A hospital management system (HMS) is a computer or web based system that
facilitates managing the functioning of the hospital or any medical set up. This
system or software will help in making the whole functioning paperless. It
integrates all the information regarding patients, doctors, staff, hospital
administrative details etc. into one software. It has sections for various
professionals that make up a hospital. In this project, we are using HTML, CSS,
JavaScript and Python. Hospital management system is a custom built to meet
the specific requirements of the mid and large size hospitals across the globe.
Prolonged study of the functionalities of the hospital and its specific
requirements has given it a wonderful shape both technically and usability
wide. The purpose of this project is to automate or make hospital management
through online which serves benefit for both customers and hospital
personnel.

Introduction:
Hospitals are seen as the focal healthcare providers in developing economies.
In this regard, hospitals should be the primary target organizations for
advancing health information systems in such economies. The World Health
Organization (WHO), disputed that hospitals are fundamental for medical and
social organizations that provide comprehensive health care to people.
Just like any large business organization, a hospital requires a complete
management system that is flexible, data-based, and innovative to function
properly. This is because a hospital is one of the most complexes of
administrative organizations and numerous operational works such as
recording Patients information, recording diagnosis-related information
administered to Patients, information storage about various diseases and
available medications to cure them, generation of bills are done in a hospital.
Computerized hospital management systems improve information
management and quality of patient care by replacing the paper or manual way
of doing things.
Due to the increasing population needs and aids to the practicing doctors,
hospital service efficiency, there is a very high demand for Hospital
Information systems in hospitals.

   render the documents into multimedia web pages.
2. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS): Cascading style sheets is the style sheet
   language used for describing the presentation of the documents written
   in a markup language such as HTML or XML.
3. JavaScript (JS): JavaScript is the program used for creating dynamic and
   interactive web content like application and browsers.
4. Python: Python is the high level and general purpose programming
   language. Python is commonly used for developing websites and
   software, data analysis and visualization, task automation.
